title: $MODEL_NAME Daily occurrence of lightning
description: |
  Extracts and plots the daily occurrence of lightning between 0900 UTC and
  0900 UTC the following day in $MODEL_NAME. The minimum
  is created from a rolling 24 h window, adds hour of day coordinate, and then
  selects the 21 UTC hour from the rolling window as this represents the validity
  time of the required range. The presence of lightning can occur any time in
  the 24-h window.
